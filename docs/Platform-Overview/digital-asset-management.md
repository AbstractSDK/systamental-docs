# Digital Asset Management {#1c946a0cd0c380e799b5d23039a11aca}


## The Future of Asset Management is Onchain {#1c946a0cd0c380d99ad1faa08c357555}


The global financial system is undergoing a profound transformation. Trust in public and private institutions is at historic lows, driving demand for decentralized, trustless, and permissionless financial technology. Blockchain is shifting power away from centralized entities and restoring financial sovereignty to individuals.


This transformation goes beyond money and payments—it's reshaping the entire financial system. Just as self-custodial wallets enable a "bankless" world, fund tokenization will redefine asset management. Instead of relying on traditional fund managers, investors can access on-chain investment products that are more scalable, transparent, liquid, customizable, and cost-efficient.


Fund tokenization represents a paradigm shift in asset management—unlocking new financial primitives, expanding access, and benefiting every investor.


## The Problem {#1c946a0cd0c38073b548eb30783738ca}


A significant gap exists between traditional finance (TradFi) investment products and on-chain offerings:

- **Institutional-grade investment strategies** that manage trillions in assets are largely unavailable on-chain
- **Off-chain alternatives** remain exclusive to institutions, burdened by high fees, low transparency, and significant intermediary risk

Current investment products suffer from critical shortcomings:

- **Poor quality** – Most on-chain options are limited to buy-and-hold strategies or yield products with hidden risks
- **Restricted access** – Sophisticated portfolio management is locked behind accreditation requirements
- **Excessive fees** – Many hedge funds disguise beta as alpha, charging steep fees for generic exposures
- **Outdated infrastructure** – Traditional fund structures lack transparency, liquidity, and programmability

## Our Solution {#1c946a0cd0c3805aae93d00fe40c6106}


Abstract Money brings institutional-grade investment products to DeFi, making them accessible to all investors. By leveraging fund tokenization, we provide access to sophisticated investment strategies with greater transparency, lower costs, improved tax efficiency, and reduced intermediary risk.

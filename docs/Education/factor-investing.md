# Factor Investing {#1ca46a0cd0c380dc84fac173694596fd}


Factor investing is a strategy that targets specific drivers of return across asset classes. This approach is based on decades of academic research and has been widely adopted by institutional investors.


## What are Factors? {#1ca46a0cd0c38039a567ee6670fe2d1c}


Factors are characteristics shared by a group of securities that help explain their returns and risks. They represent systematic sources of risk and return that persist across time and markets.


### Key Types of Factors {#1ca46a0cd0c380bdba91d84a6a3b0b3d}


### Macroeconomic Factors {#1ca46a0cd0c3803fb395d00b5b1d93dd}


These factors capture broad risks across asset classes:

- Economic growth
- Inflation
- Interest rates
- Liquidity
- Credit

### Style Factors (Cross-Sectional) {#1ca46a0cd0c380a496f4c5e30b5024e7}


These factors explain returns within asset classes:

- Value
- Momentum
- Size
- Quality
- Volatility
- Yield/Carry

## The Evidence for Factor Investing {#1ca46a0cd0c380e78e0afa939ba3b895}


### Academic Foundation {#1ca46a0cd0c380b18687d1cd76516e57}


Factor investing is grounded in decades of academic research, beginning with:

- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** - Identified market beta as the primary factor explaining returns
- **Arbitrage Pricing Theory** - Expanded to multiple factors affecting asset prices
- **Fama-French Three-Factor Model** - Added size and value factors to market beta
- **Carhart Four-Factor Model** - Added momentum as a fourth factor

### Empirical Evidence {#1ca46a0cd0c380e3b5efef724b6b90f7}


Extensive empirical research has documented factor premiums across:

- Different time periods
- Various geographic markets
- Multiple asset classes (equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, and now crypto)

## Why Factors Work {#1ca46a0cd0c38008b295f8c0048bc19d}


Factors generate returns through three primary mechanisms:

1. **Risk Premiums** - Compensation for bearing systematic risks
2. **Structural Impediments** - Institutional constraints that prevent certain market participants from exploiting opportunities
3. **Behavioral Biases** - Systematic errors in human decision-making

## Factor Investing in Crypto {#1ca46a0cd0c380099083ec54c81f2cac}


The crypto market exhibits many of the same factor premiums found in traditional markets, along with some unique characteristics:


### Traditional Factors in Crypto {#1ca46a0cd0c380a49f6fd8e58d1d8712}

- **Momentum** - Trend-following strategies have shown strong performance in crypto markets
- **Size** - Smaller-cap cryptocurrencies often outperform larger ones in bull markets
- **Value** - Tokens trading below fundamental value metrics tend to outperform over time

### Crypto-Specific Factors {#1ca46a0cd0c380ea9ad5e5004fab3af6}

- **Network Value to Transactions (NVT)** - Similar to a P/E ratio for cryptocurrencies
- **On-chain Activity** - Metrics related to network usage and adoption
- **Protocol Revenue** - Income generated by blockchain protocols
- **Liquidity** - Measures of trading volume and market depth

## Implementing Factor Strategies {#1ca46a0cd0c380f4850ee8cd28d999c4}


### Single-Factor Strategies {#1ca46a0cd0c380eea5bdca6d65c3122f}


These strategies target exposure to a single factor:

- **Trend Following** - Captures momentum factor by following price trends
- **Yield Farming** - Captures carry factor by harvesting yield differentials
- **Value Investing** - Targets undervalued assets based on fundamental metrics

### Multi-Factor Strategies {#1ca46a0cd0c380a588fad8b80cbb1d2c}


These strategies combine multiple factors to:

- Improve diversification
- Reduce factor cyclicality
- Enhance risk-adjusted returns

### Factor Timing vs. Diversification {#1ca46a0cd0c38039965dd31b276e9b8f}


Two primary approaches to managing factor exposures:

- **Factor Timing** - Tactically adjusting factor exposures based on expected performance
- **Factor Diversification** - Maintaining exposure to multiple factors to reduce cyclicality

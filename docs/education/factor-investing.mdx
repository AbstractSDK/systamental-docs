# Factor Investing

Factor investing is a strategy that targets specific drivers of return across asset classes. This approach is based on decades of academic research and has been widely adopted by institutional investors.

## What are Factors?

Factors are characteristics shared by a group of securities that help explain their returns and risks. They represent systematic sources of risk and return that persist across time and markets.

### Key Types of Factors

#### Macroeconomic Factors
These factors capture broad risks across asset classes:
- Economic growth
- Inflation
- Interest rates
- Liquidity
- Credit

#### Style Factors (Cross-Sectional)
These factors explain returns within asset classes:
- Value
- Momentum
- Size
- Quality
- Volatility
- Yield/Carry

## The Evidence for Factor Investing

### Academic Foundation

Factor investing is grounded in decades of academic research, beginning with:

- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** - Identified market beta as the primary factor explaining returns
- **Arbitrage Pricing Theory** - Expanded to multiple factors affecting asset prices
- **Fama-French Three-Factor Model** - Added size and value factors to market beta
- **Carhart Four-Factor Model** - Added momentum as a fourth factor

### Empirical Evidence

Extensive empirical research has documented factor premiums across:
- Different time periods
- Various geographic markets
- Multiple asset classes (equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, and now crypto)

## Why Factors Work

Factors generate returns through three primary mechanisms:

1. **Risk Premiums** - Compensation for bearing systematic risks
2. **Structural Impediments** - Institutional constraints that prevent certain market participants from exploiting opportunities
3. **Behavioral Biases** - Systematic errors in human decision-making

## Factor Investing in Crypto

The crypto market exhibits many of the same factor premiums found in traditional markets, along with some unique characteristics:

### Traditional Factors in Crypto
- **Momentum** - Trend-following strategies have shown strong performance in crypto markets
- **Size** - Smaller-cap cryptocurrencies often outperform larger ones in bull markets
- **Value** - Tokens trading below fundamental value metrics tend to outperform over time

### Crypto-Specific Factors
- **Network Value to Transactions (NVT)** - Similar to a P/E ratio for cryptocurrencies
- **On-chain Activity** - Metrics related to network usage and adoption
- **Protocol Revenue** - Income generated by blockchain protocols
- **Liquidity** - Measures of trading volume and market depth

## Implementing Factor Strategies

### Single-Factor Strategies

These strategies target exposure to a single factor:
- **Trend Following** - Captures momentum factor by following price trends
- **Yield Farming** - Captures carry factor by harvesting yield differentials
- **Value Investing** - Targets undervalued assets based on fundamental metrics

### Multi-Factor Strategies

These strategies combine multiple factors to:
- Improve diversification
- Reduce factor cyclicality
- Enhance risk-adjusted returns

### Factor Timing vs. Diversification

Two primary approaches to managing factor exposures:
- **Factor Timing** - Tactically adjusting factor exposures based on expected performance
- **Factor Diversification** - Maintaining exposure to multiple factors to reduce cyclicality

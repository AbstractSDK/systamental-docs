# What is Abstract Money?

**Abstract Money** is a DeFi-native digital asset management platform delivering institutional-grade investment products and portfolio management solutions to all investors.

Our platform bridges the gap between traditional finance and on-chain offerings, making sophisticated investment strategies accessible to everyone through tokenized vaults that are fully-backed, transparent, and composable throughout DeFi.

We provide access to:

- [**Institutional-grade investment products**](./streams) – Allocate to strategies that generate positive, uncorrelated, and composable returns.
- [**Tokenized funds**](./vaults) – Use our tokenized vault infrastructure to convert signals, systematic strategies, and risk exposures into tradable assets.
- **Portfolio construction and analysis** – Build more optimal portfolios and understand their underlying risk factor exposures.
- **Data and dashboards** – Monitor crypto market drivers with proprietary data and real-time analytics.

## The Future of Asset Management is On-Chain

The global financial system is undergoing a profound transformation. Trust in public and private institutions is at historic lows, driving demand for decentralized, trustless, and permissionless financial technology. Blockchain is shifting power away from centralized entities and restoring financial sovereignty to individuals.

This transformation goes beyond money and payments—it’s reshaping the entire financial system. Just as self-custodial wallets enable a "bankless" world, fund tokenization will redefine asset management. Instead of relying on traditional fund managers, investors can access on-chain investment products that are more scalable, transparent, liquid, customizable, and cost-efficient.

Fund tokenization represents a paradigm shift in asset management—unlocking new financial primitives, expanding access, and benefiting every investor.

## The Problem

A significant gap exists between traditional finance (TradFi) investment products and on-chain offerings:

- **Institutional-grade investment strategies** that manage trillions in assets are largely unavailable on-chain
- **Off-chain alternatives** remain exclusive to institutions, burdened by high fees, low transparency, and significant intermediary risk

Current investment products suffer from critical shortcomings:

- **Poor quality** – Most on-chain options are limited to buy-and-hold strategies or yield products with hidden risks
- **Restricted access** – Sophisticated portfolio management is locked behind accreditation requirements
- **Excessive fees** – Many hedge funds disguise beta as alpha, charging steep fees for generic exposures
- **Outdated infrastructure** – Traditional fund structures lack transparency, liquidity, and programmability

## Our Solution

Abstract Money brings institutional-grade investment products to DeFi, making them accessible to all investors. By leveraging fund tokenization, we provide access to sophisticated investment strategies with greater transparency, lower costs, improved tax efficiency, and reduced intermediary risk.

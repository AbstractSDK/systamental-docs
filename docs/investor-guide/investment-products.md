# Investment Products

Abstract Money offers a range of institutional-grade investment building blocks enabling investors to construct diversified, high-performance portfolios. Our products are categorized into four main types:

- **Betas** – Low-cost market exposure through **smart betas** and indexes.
- **Factors** – Systematic return sources (e.g., **trend, yield/carry, value**) that are **uncorrelated to long crypto exposures**.
- **Alphas** – Idiosyncratic return sources that are **uncorrelated to both factors and the broader market**.
- **Portable Alphas** – Enhance returns by **stacking factors or alpha strategies on top of existing asset or index exposures**.

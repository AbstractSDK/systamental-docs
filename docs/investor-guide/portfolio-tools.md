# Portfolio Tools

Abstract Money provides sophisticated portfolio tools typically available only to institutional investors. These tools help you build, analyze, and optimize your investment portfolio.

## Portfolio Optimization

Our optimization tools help you construct portfolios that maximize returns for a given level of risk.

### Mean-Variance Optimization

This classic approach helps you find the portfolio allocation that maximizes the Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return).

### Risk-Based Optimizers

These approaches focus on managing risk rather than maximizing returns.

**Available methods:**
- **Risk Parity**: Equalizes risk contribution across assets
- **Maximum Diversification**: Maximizes the diversification ratio
- **Minimum Variance**: Creates the portfolio with the lowest possible volatility

## Factor Analysis

Understand the underlying drivers of your portfolio's performance with factor analysis.

**Key features:**
- Decompose portfolio risk into systematic and idiosyncratic components
- Identify exposure to common factors (market, size, momentum, etc.)
- Understand sources of correlation between different investments
- Discover hidden risks in seemingly diversified portfolios

## Portfolio Simulation

Test how your portfolio might perform under different market conditions.
